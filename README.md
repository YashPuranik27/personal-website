# personal-website
This is the repo of my personal website. I am going to primarily be writing in javascript and doing my database in SQL. I will also be using modern web development tech like React, Docker, Node.js, AWS Cloud, and MySQL.

The purpose of this website is to get some hands on experience with using some of the technology that i've always been fascinated with.

Here is the overview of my tech stack I plan on using: (this might/will change)

# tech stack I will be using

**Frontend**
React: The UI will be built in react for a more dynamic and responsive look.
CSS/SCSS: To style the website.

**Backend**
Node.js: I am using Node.js to build the server-side application to handle API requests and serve data to the frontend.

**Database**
MySQL: I am using MySQL to store and manage data for my projects, experience, and other content.

**Containerization and Deployment**
Docker: I'm going to try to use docker to containerize the application for portability and consistency across environments.
AWS Cloud: I'm going to host the application and database using AWS services (AWS Elastic Beanstalk for the app and RDS for the database).

**Development Environment**
Visual Studio Code: Develop and manage the codebase.
